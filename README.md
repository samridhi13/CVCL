In this project, we examined the provided research paper and attempted to replicate the authors' results by using their model. Our contribution involves implementing the Soft Adapt Algorithm, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts weights based on the model's performance in previous iterations. As a result, we achieved an accuracy of 98.84% on the BDGP dataset.

Thank you.
